##Requirements

Thesis Theme Framework for WordPress: http://www.64notes.com/thesis

##How to Use

* Copy Files in /custom folder to your custom folder in "thesis_xx"
* In Thesis > Manage Options. Upload "thesis-design-options-xxxxxxx.dat" file as Design Options.
* Modify files in custom/images to change logo, etc.

##Misc
The file structe contains /src and config.rb which beause I used compass (SASS) to create the css file. I've included it in repo so it's easy to modify for pro's and a good way to learn fro n00bs.
